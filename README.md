Server Admin GUI
===============

This is a (future) MinecraftForge mod that will allow for server admins to perform various
useful functions.


All of this is dependent on if I can get the GUI library working as intended.

TODO
=====
* Allow server admins to create/customize entities
* Customize existing loot tables (maybe create?)
